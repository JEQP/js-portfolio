# Portfolio

A responsive portfolio featuring six projects with which I have been involved. Mixer Upper and One Page Man were collaborative efforts, while the others were single projects for Bootcamp.

Styled with Bootstrap and using "Trade Wind" font from Google Fonts. An external Javascript file is used to change the showcased content based on the users' clicks.
